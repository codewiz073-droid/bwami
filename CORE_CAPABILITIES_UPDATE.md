## How They Work Together

### Simple Integration
```
Language Model Foundation (Core Knowledge)
         ↓
    Information Synthesis (Combine)
         ↓
Real-Time Data & Visual (Enhance)
         ↓
    High-Quality Response
```

### Example Query Flow
```
User: "Identify this plant and show current care tips"

Process:
1. Visual Search: Identifies plant from image
2. Real-Time Data: Finds current care information
3. Information Synthesis: Combines both sources
4. Language Model: Structures coherent response
5. Output: Plant ID + current care guide
```
